/*
ASSIGNMENT NO: 7
Aim: Study of Arrays
Watson Elementary School contains 10 classrooms numbered 1 to 10. Each classroom can
contain any number of students up to 12. Each student takes an achievement test at the end of the
school year and receives a score from 0 through 100. Write a program that accepts data for each
student in the schoolâ€”student ID, classroom number, and score on the achievement test. Design
a program that lists the total points scored for each of the 10 classrooms.
